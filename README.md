**Metro Card Balance Checker** is a full-stack web application that allows users to easily check their metro card balance. The application consists of a React.js-based frontend and an Express.js-based backend. The client interface provides users with a sleek and intuitive platform to input their metro card details, while the backend handles API requests to fetch balance data securely.
